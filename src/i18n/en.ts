    storyContent: "At Globfest, our journey began with a simple belief: that the ornaments we hang on our trees should be as unique as the memories we make during the holiday season. What started as a small passion project in a home workshop has blossomed into a community dedicated to preserving the artisanal craft of hand-painting glass ornaments.\n\nEvery single bauble in our collection is a labor of love. We don't believe in mass production; instead, we celebrate the slight imperfections and variations that come from a human hand holding a brush. Our artists spend hours on each piece, drawing inspiration from both timeless Christmas traditions and the subtle beauty of the natural world.\n\nBut Globfest is about more than just decoration. We founded this project with a mission to give back. That's why a portion of every sale goes directly to supporting causes that make a real difference in people's lives—from local community centers to organizations helping children with special needs. We believe that true holiday magic is found in the act of giving and sharing warmth with others.\n\nWhen you choose a Globfest bauble, you're not just buying an ornament; you're supporting an artist, contributing to a meaningful cause, and bringing a piece of genuine craftsmanship into your home. We are honored to be a part of your family's festive traditions and look forward to adding a touch of hand-painted magic to your celebrations for many years to come.",

<p>First of all, it's important to cover the bauble with a homogeneous color (e.g., white, black, red, green).</p>
<p>Leave the bauble to dry and have a mulled wine / a warm tea and chat with your loved ones.</p>
<p>Choose an easy-to-realize pattern: a snowman, animals with Santa hats (cats, sheep, penguins, swans, bears, rabbits, etc.), snowy houses, Christmas trees, etc. Ideally, you should outline the drawing, then color it, and then outline the final product again.</p>
<p>At the end, add filler elements: flakes, bells, candles, fir branches, gift boxes, letters, sponge cake, mistletoe, steaming mugs, orange slices, glasses of wine, Christmas lights, etc.</p>
<p>And if there's still room, you can add a signature, for example: Globfest or a cute message.</p>

<p class="text-lg font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Below are some sketches I made in a hurry 😄 to inspire you.</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 text-christmas-red">❄️ Flakes</h3>
<p>When drawing a flake, you can be very creative. Just imagine you have some mandalas to create and pour out what you feel.</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 text-christmas-red">🎄 Trees</h3>
<p>And when drawing trees, you can play with different patterns. Likewise, you can add personal elements. Don't be afraid to be inventive (ideally, first on a draft, to see if you really like it).</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 text-christmas-red">⛄ Snowmen</h3>
<p>For snowmen, I presented 3 difficulty levels (1 – easiest, 2 – medium, 3 – more difficult).</p>
